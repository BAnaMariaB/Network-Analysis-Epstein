Hosain Rahman,business,"Taken together, the files suggest a deteriorating relationship between Hosain Rahman, the former CEO of Jawbone, and Jeffrey Epstein that began after in-person interactions in 2012, including visits to Zorro Ranch and references to possible boat gatherings. What appears to start as social and business access later shifts into conflict over money, control, and alleged misrepresentations. By 2017–2018, the correspondence reflects explicit legal tension, with Epstein accusing Rahman of wrongdoing related to Jawbone and subsequent ventures, and Rahman seeking to resolve claims through confidential settlement discussions. Notably, even after Epstein’s criminal history was well established, a Jawbone Health entity offered Epstein-linked Southern Trust Company a formal “Senior Advisor” role, including proposed equity compensation tied to strategic introductions in the Middle East, underscoring the depth and persistence of the financial relationship.",Hos; Hosain,0,0,0,No,Pakistani American
