Here is an invitation you can forward. Fingers crossed.

I'm going upstairs to hunt for my copy of Lolita, or will get on my kindle and reread on our way to Australia. I may have lent it to one of my kids. I would recommend reading My Antonia by Cather next time you're on a long plane trip. The prose is gorgeous, and the book has-- come to think of it-- similar themes to Lolita in that it's about a man whose whole life is stamped forever by his impression of a young girl.

Thank y",

2018-07-13,Paul Barrett,,Jeffrey Epstein,AVGO,My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea.

No real communication. Cannot open the NYT article. But to judge from the article's title they are at least exaggerating if not totally wrong. This attack will not change strategy in a major way on either side. It will however raise respect for DJT in Moscow and few other capitals. That's not necessarily bad, if the WH won't read this change as a precedent which calls to be repeated too often.

Dear Jeffrey:

As requested, the following addresses your two questions / concerns about our proposed Closer To Truth TV series ""The Science of Sleep and Dreams"":

(i) Have there been sufficient breakthroughs in Sleep and Dreams (significantly beyond traditional understandings) to justify a major TV series?
(ii) Even if 'yes' to (i), is now the proper time for such a foundational serie",

Looks like Trump is back in game. We processed 11 million tweets this week for Trump and 50.03% are positive and only 20.66% are negative whereas Clinton is 56.05% negative and 20.03% positive.

We are trying to correlate that into popular vote outcome and electoral votes received.

2016-09-27,Zubair Khan,,Jeffrey Epstein,Update on US Elections,"We have processed 943,338 tweets since the start of the presidential debate till now. 

Clinton's popularity has increased dramatically since the debate. According to our recent data, 62% support Clinton and 38% Trump. 

Clinton is now more popular in New York, California and Michigan. She is likely to win in these states with huge margins. Clinton has also gained popularity in Texas (Clinton 65% - Trump 35%).

Trump has huge support in Ohio (90% Trump - 10% Clinton) and in New Jersey.

2013-11-12,i,,,Re: B727 deal,"Jeffrey,

I spoke to Gary and he agrees to make a counter offer, do you agree with the following:

-Counter the offer at $2.750M

-deal to include my FAR125 certificate, along with the company name: JEGE, Inc. this provides the buyer with ease of
transition and keeps the B727 on its current FAR125, tremendous value to buyer,.

-Buyer understands purchase is ""As Is"" but has the opportunity to visually inspect the aircraft in Palm Bch along with my
records.

-closing to be on December 30th 2013.
